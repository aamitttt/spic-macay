           <p id="section1" class="eve">Flute has its legacy dating back to thousands of BC. The oldest Flute
           discovered dates back to approximately 43,000 years. This hierarchy still
           continues to thrive the world with Western, Indian, Chinese cultures being
           into strong existence. When combined with Tabla this beautiful juncture is
           something to feel and witness. Exactly the same was realised by the audience
           of NIT Rourkela.
           Adding another feather in the cap, the beautiful evening of November 2nd
           bought glory to the NIT Rourkela chapter of SPIC MACAY. The audience of
           NITR witnessed an enthralling display of classical musical sprinkling out from
           the Flute of Shri Srinibas Satapathy accompanied by Shri Biswaranjan Nanda
           on Tabla.
           An ‘Ustad Bismillah Khan Yuva Puraskar’ awardee Shri Satapathy owes from
           Utkal Sangeet Mahavidyalaya where he completed his graduation and
           masters. Basically being from Bhubaneswar he has been a part of Gandharva
           Mahavidyalaya and has learnt under greats including Pandit Raghunath
           Panigrahi and Pandit Rajendra Prasanna. Shri Satapathy believes that flute
           players are no longer seen as accompanists, but have their own significant
           identity. Accompanied by him was no lesser in his art Shri Biswaranjan Nanda
           owing again from Utkal Sangeet Mahavidyalaya and delivering his services at
           Utkal University of Culture.
           We thank such great artist for endeavouring us with their heart touching

           difficult to play. Sarod is known for a deep, weighty, introspective sound, in
           contrast with the sweet, overtone-rich texture of the sitar, with sympathetic
           strings that give it a resonant, reverberant quality.
