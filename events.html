        discovered dates back to approximately 43,000 years. This hierarchy still
        continues to thrive the world with Western, Indian, Chinese cultures being
        into strong existence. When combined with Tabla this beautiful juncture is
        something to feel and witness. Exactly the same was realised by the audience
        of NIT Rourkela.
        Adding another feather in the cap, the beautiful evening of November 2nd
        bought glory to the NIT Rourkela chapter of SPIC MACAY. The audience of
        NITR witnessed an enthralling display of classical musical sprinkling out from
        the Flute of Shri Srinibas Satapathy accompanied by Shri Biswaranjan Nanda
        on Tabla.
        An ‘Ustad Bismillah Khan Yuva Puraskar’ awardee Shri Satapathy owes from
        Utkal Sangeet Mahavidyalaya where he completed his graduation and
        masters. Basically being from Bhubaneswar he has been a part of Gandharva
        Mahavidyalaya and has learnt under greats including Pandit Raghunath
        Panigrahi and Pandit Rajendra Prasanna. Shri Satapathy believes that flute
        players are no longer seen as accompanists, but have their own significant
        identity. Accompanied by him was no lesser in his art Shri Biswaranjan Nanda
        owing again from Utkal Sangeet Mahavidyalaya and delivering his services at
        Utkal University of Culture.
        We thank such great artist for endeavouring us with their heart touching
